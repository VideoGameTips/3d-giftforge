# ⚙️ How It Works

1. 🎯 **Pick a friend** you want to make something for.
2. 🧑‍💻 **Come to my house** (we’ll schedule it!) and we’ll design the item together.
3. 🖨️ **I’ll print it** on my 3D printer — completely free.
4. 🎁 **You give the gift** to your friend. And maybe they'll want to make a gift too!

Let’s keep the chain going!
