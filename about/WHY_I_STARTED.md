# ðŸ”¥ Why I Started 3D GiftForge

Iâ€™m in 7th grade, and I wanted to make more friends while also sharing something I love â€” 3D printing.

Instead of just printing things for myself, I thought:  
**What if we could use the printer to make gifts for each other instead?**

That way, we:
- Get to make cool stuff
- Make someone happy
- Make new friends in the process

Itâ€™s about **generosity, creativity, and community**.
