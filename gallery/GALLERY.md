## 🛠️ Demonstration Projects

These are sample prints I made for fun and learning. They're **not for myself** in the GiftForge cycle — just examples to show what's possible with a 3D printer!

### 🐉 Octopus & Articulated Dragons
![Octopus and Dragons](./img/octopus_n_dragons.png)  
A group of articulated toys, including flexible dragons and a spider-like octopus. These are fan favorites and show how movable joints can be printed fully assembled.

### 🌀 Spiral Vase
![Spiral Vase](./img/vase.png)  
Printed in silky PLA, this spiral vase shows off how 3D printing can make beautiful and functional objects. This was a test for texture and layering.

### 🐘 Stuffy Elephant
![Stuffy Elephant](./img/stuffy_elephant.png)  
This cute elephant looks like it’s made of yarn — but it’s all plastic! Great for gift ideas for younger siblings or classmates.

### 🐠 Flexible Stingray
![Flexible Stingray](./img/flexible_stingray.png)  
This model is flat but bendable. A cool example of how 3D printing can make "fidgety" toys that feel alive.

### ✈️ SR-71 Blackbird (Plane)
![SR-71 Plane](./img/plane.png)  
Modeled after a real jet, this plane has impressive detail. Great for aviation fans!

### 🔫 Spring Gun
![Spring Gun](./img/spring_gun.png)  
This colorful toy gun was printed in parts and assembled after. It’s a good example of multicolor and mechanical design.
