# ❌ Rules of 3D GiftForge

### 🚫 No printing for yourself
This is the #1 rule.  
If everyone just prints for themselves, the kindness chain ends.

### ✅ Must be for a friend
Think of someone who deserves a cool surprise. That’s who you’re designing for.

### 🤝 Respect design time and materials
We’ll work together, but please be thoughtful about the time and effort.

The whole project works only if everyone gives forward!
